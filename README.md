# PRESENT STATUS

## JUST STARTED

This is a web GUI for viewing HDF5 files.

The HDF5 Group  [made their own web ui]('http://data.hdfgroup.org/'),
but they don't want to share :(

They do however want to share their HDF5 file server backend, so we have that
going for us, which is nice.

This web GUI is written in javascript and make use of the
[plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/) graphing libraries.

## SCREENSHOTS
3-dimensional, rotatable, zoomable plots of data can be made. Here's a
screenshot:

Here's a screenshot of a 2-dimensional zoomable contour plot of the same data,
with x and y profile histograms that match the zoomed-in area:

## INSTALLATIONS
For testing purposes, it has been installed on the
[scilab machine]('http://w-v-scilab-cc-0/hdf5-web-gui/html/')

Hopefully the server is running and data is actually being displayed...
